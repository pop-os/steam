Description: Valve's Steam digital software delivery system
 Steam (https://www.steampowered.com) is a software content delivery system
 developed by Valve software (https://www.valvesoftware.com).  There is
 some free software available, but for the most part the content delivered
 is non-free.
 .
 This package comes with a fairly substantial non-free license agreement
 that must be accepted before installing the software.  If you have any
 opposition to non-free work, please select "I DECLINE" during the package
 installation dialogs.   There are also additional agreements in various
 parts of the application that differ from the original agreement.  In
 other words, pay attention and read carefully if you're worried about your
 rights.

Description: Installer for Valve's Steam digital software delivery system
 Steam (https://www.steampowered.com) is a software content delivery system
 developed by Valve software (https://www.valvesoftware.com).  There is
 some free software available, but for the most part the content delivered
 is non-free.
 .
 This package enables Steam to be easily installed via an appstream client
 on non-i386 systems as long as the i386 foreign architecture is configured.
 This is the default on Ubuntu, but on Debian, you may need to run as root:
 dpkg --add-architecture i386; apt update
 .
 This package is not needed if you only want to install Steam directly with
 apt or with a non-appstream client like Synaptic.
