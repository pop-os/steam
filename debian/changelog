steam (1:1.0.0.74-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream stable release
    - Updated Steam client binary, build 1637624439 (2021-11-02)

steam (1:1.0.0.73-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream stable release
    - Updated Steam client binary, build 1634158817 (2021-10-13)
    - The other upstream changes do not directly affect this package
  * Add Suggests on pipewire, and Recommends on libegl1 and libgbm1.
    These are used for Steam Remote Play / Steam Link video capture,
    particularly when running on Wayland, and we want their i386 versions.
  * Add Recommends on libva2 (VA-API) and its drivers.
    Steam Remote Play uses VA-API for hardware-accelerated encoding
    (server-side, running the game) and decoding (client-side, playing
    the game) on Mesa-supported GPUs, currently via i386 binaries.
  * Remove Recommends: bubblewrap.
    Since Debian 11, we do not need a setuid bubblewrap by default, and the
    version shipped in the SteamLinuxRuntime_soldier depot is enough.

steam (1:1.0.0.71-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bump epoch to 1.
    This aligns with the version numbers used by Valve and Ubuntu, and
    ensures that an unrelated package that used the 'steam' name prior to
    2010 (sTeam, a wiki) is correctly superseded.
  * d/scripts/steam.in: Stop deleting libraries from the Steam Runtime.
    The Steam Runtime is designed to defer to the libraries from the host
    system whenever the version on the host system is newer, or whenever
    the versions in the Steam Runtime and on the host system cannot be
    compared, so it should not be necessary to edit it in-place.
    All situations where this does not work are believed to have been fixed
    upstream. If they have not, the upstream developers want to receive
    issue reports with diagnostic logs from steam-runtime-system-info, so
    that the runtime can be fixed.
  * d/scripts/steam.in: Remove workaround for #882607.
    This shouldn't be necessary any more, particularly since Valve is now
    known to be working on a SteamOS 3 update that is based on Arch Linux
    (where libdbus assertion failures have always been fatal).
  * Upload to unstable for bookworm release cycle.
    Steam launcher 1.0.0.71 has been promoted from beta to stable upstream.

steam (1.0.0.70-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Depend on system libxi6:i386 to work around bugs in the Steam
    Runtime's older version (Closes: #990233)
  * Add Recommends on libsdl2-2.0-0:i386.
    This is an important library for most games and for Steam itself, and
    will also pull in up-to-date i386 versions of its dependencies. These
    i386 libraries will be used in preference to the rather outdated
    versions in the Steam Runtime, mitigating bugs like #990233. Users
    of wine32 will have these already.

steam (1.0.0.67-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Swap Suggests: nvidia-driver-libs-i386 to nvidia-driver-libs.
    The nvidia-driver-libs-i386 package is unavailable since bullseye.
    However, nvidia-driver-libs is Multi-Arch: same and the steam package
    is Architecture: i386, so the new Suggests will also pull in
    nvidia-driver-libs:i386, which is what we want. (Closes: #979121)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 03 Jan 2021 11:14:20 +0000

steam (1.0.0.67-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add Recommends on libasound2-plugins.
    This is required for PulseAudio output in 32-bit games. amd64
    users will typically already have libasound2-plugins:amd64, but not
    libasound2-plugins:i386; however, the steam package is on i386, so it
    is in an ideal position to pull in 32-bit libraries. (Closes: #977272)
  * d/steam.lintian-overrides: Remove an obsolete tag
  * d/source/lintian-overrides: Mark source-is-missing as known.
    The Steam client's source code is not available, and we don't need
    a reminder from Lintian.
  * Standards-Version: 4.5.1 (no changes required)

  * Release to unstable.
    Version 1.0.0.67 has been promoted from beta to stable status.

    This only watches for upstream stable releases. Replace stable with beta
    to get upstream betas before they are promoted to stable status.

    - Update steam binary
    - Update udev rules to cover DualSense (Playstation 5) controller
  * Add Recommends on xdg-desktop-portal and a backend.
    These are used by Proton 5.13, which runs in a Steam Runtime v2 container,

steam (1.0.0.64-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream stable release
    - No changes since 1.0.0.63 that are relevant to this package
  * d/rules: Look at stable rather than precise upstream apt suite.
    The official sources.list.d fragment shipped with the Steam launcher
    now uses the 'stable' apt suite, since the Steam client doesn't
    actually work on Ubuntu 12.04 'precise' any more.
  * Release to unstable

  * New upstream release (currently a beta)
    - Update steam binary
    - Update steam-devices udev rules
  * debian/steam.postinst: Notify udevd to reload its rules.
    This means the steam-devices rules should take effect immediately,
    instead of being deferred until after the next reboot.

steam (1.0.0.62-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * steam(6): Don't redirect stderr to a log file.
    The upstream developers of Steam recently removed its own launch
    script's redirection (to /tmp/dumps), which has been noted to
    sometimes fill /tmp, and is less useful in practice than it was hoped
    to be. They have asked that we remove the similar redirection from
    Debian's equivalent script, so that when debugging game launch issues
    they can instruct users to run steam from an interactive terminal,
    and expect it to produce both stdout and stderr, regardless of
    whether their launch script or ours is in use. (Closes: #957284)
  * Remove libtxc-dxtn0 alternative dependency.
    We now require libgl1-mesa-dri (>= 17.3), which is available in
    Debian 10 and up, as well as Debian 9 backports.
  * Release to unstable.
    Version 1.0.0.62 has been promoted from beta to stable status.

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Tue, 12 May 2020 18:58:38 +0100

steam (1.0.0.62-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (currently considered to be a beta)
    - New directory layout
    - Update steam binary
    - Update steam-devices udev rules from
      <https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-devices/>:
      add ZeroPlus P4 (hitbox) hidraw device, 0c12:0ef6
  * d/rules: Make .orig directory configurable.
    It's canonically "..", but users of git-buildpackage often separate
    the directory with git repositories from the directory with large
    binaries.
  * d/rules: Add support for downloading beta steam-launcher versions.
    The 1.0.0.62 launcher release is currently considered to be a beta,
    which will be promoted to stable status after it has had more testing.
  * d/rules: Cope with the upstream release having an epoch.
    Ubuntu's modified version of this package has an epoch as a result of
    an older, unrelated package "sTeam" with a higher version number, which
    used to be in Debian and Ubuntu many years ago. Valve's steam package
    now has an epoch so that their 1:1.0.0.62 will be compared correctly
    against Ubuntu's 1:1.0.0.61.
  * d/rules: Be more verbose about the extraction process
  * d/rules: Keep most upstream files in the orig tarball.
    The upstream "source" tarball has been restructured, and in particular
    the udev rules (which are MIT-licensed and come from a separate git
    repository) are now in subprojects/steam-devices.
    bootstrap*.tar.* contains precompiled libraries without their
    corresponding source code (it's available from repo.steampowered.com but
    not part of the "source" package), which we intentionally don't ship. The
    crashhandler module and the steamerrorreporter executable are also
    non-essential binaries.
    The other scripts and auxiliary files in the orig tarball are
    likely to be useful references, even if we don't actually ship them in
    binary packages.
  * d/copyright.in: Update
  * d/steam-devices.install: Update for upstream restructuring
  * d/steam.install: Update for new location of steam binary.
    I've left it in a subdirectory to reduce confusion with the top-level
    ./steam in upstream's "source" tarball, which is a symlink to
    bin_steam.sh.
  * Standards-Version: 4.5.0 (no changes required)
  * d/rules: Don't run upstream Makefile
  * Build-Depend on the libraries Valve put in their bootstrap tarball.
    This ensures that we have all the necessary metadata for dpkg-shlibdeps
    to generate the ${shlibs:Depends} for the proprietary steam executable.
  * d/scripts/steam: Distinguish between ~/.steam/steam and ~/.steam/root
  * Explicitly depend on the libraries that we delete from the Steam Runtime.
    We probably shouldn't be deleting these any more, because the Steam
    Runtime explicitly prefers newer versions from the host system in all
    cases, and if there are bugs in that mechanism that make deleting them
    necessary, Valve would like to know about them so they can be fixed -
    but for now, preserve historical behaviour.
  * d/steam-bug.presubj: Recommend running steam-runtime-system-info.
    This diagnostic tool was written for use in upstream bug reports, but
    is equally valuable for downstream distributors like us.
  * Depend on libgl1 instead of transitional libgl1-mesa-glx
    (Closes: #930613)
  * Use https for more URLs.
    In particular, https://repo.steampowered.com now works, and appears
    in upstream documentation.
  * d/copyright: Set Upstream-Name to steam-launcher.
    The upstream dpkg source package is still named steam for historical
    reasons, but it builds steam-launcher_*.deb, and calling it
    "steam-launcher" is a good way to disambiguate between the
    launcher/bootstrapper (which is what we're actually packaging here)
    and the full Steam client (which is downloaded by the launcher, and
    is what users normally see).
  * Move steam-devices Recommends into sorted order
  * Add Depends on file, used by the Steam Runtime setup scripts
  * Add Recommends on xdg-utils, which is used to launch URL handlers
  * Add Recommends on zenity, which Steam assumes is present
  * Add Depends on curl, used to download Steam updates
  * d/scripts/steam: Put location and version in environment variables.
    Recent Steam diagnostic tools use this to identify how Steam was
    launched.

    - d/p/udev-uinput.patch: Drop, applied upstream
    - d/p/udev-permissions.patch: Drop, mostly applied upstream.
      The only remaining differences in our package were:
      + Setting TAG+="uaccess" twice on SteamVR device nodes, which
        we can drop since it's redundant (once is enough)
      + Setting MODE="0660" on /dev/uinput, which is the default anyway

steam (1.0.0.59-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add Conflicts/Replaces on steam-launcher.
    steam-launcher is a Valve-provided package containing the same
    launcher as Debian's steam package, and the same udev rules as
    Debian's steam-devices package. They are not co-installable: please
    install the steam and steam-devices packages from Debian non-free,
    *or* the steam and steam-launcher packages from Valve, but do not
    mix the two sources.
  * steam-devices: Add Breaks/Replaces on non-matching versions of
    steam. This should prevent mixing Debian's steam and steam-devices
    with Valve's steam-launcher and steam, while allowing switching
    between the two to work. (Closes: #920600)
  * d/scripts/steam: Delete libxcb-dri3.so.0 from the Steam Runtime,
    and add a versioned dependency on a newer version for the host
    system. This library added ABI without increasing the -version-info,
    which means the Steam launcher script can't decide that Debian's
    copy is newer and use it in preference to the Steam Runtime copy.
    (Closes: #921026)
  * Version the dependencies on libgpg-error0 and libxinerama1 to make
    sure the copies on the host system are at least as new as those
    provided by the Steam Runtime.
  * d/steam.bug-control: Add more information to bug reports

  * d/gbp.conf: Explicitly disable pristine-tar for this package.
    We don't keep upstream "source" in the git repository since that
    mostly consists of binary blobs.
  * Display a debconf note if the Nvidia proprietary kernel module is

    This seems to be the best we can do without adding a Recommends

  * Add myself to Uploaders
  * Import debian/ into salsa.debian.org git (Closes: #913651)

    d/copyright is generated from d/copyright.in and license files.
    (Closes: #916300)
  * Upgrade steam-devices to a hard dependency.
    The udev rules are increasingly used by the Steam client for input
    remapping, even if no Steam-specific hardware is used. (Closes: #916298)
  * Allow cross-compilation for i386 on a non-i386 build machine
    (Closes: #916301)
  * steam-devices: Mark as Multi-Arch: foreign.
    Otherwise, this package can't satisfy the steam package's dependency
    when installed with `dpkg -i` on an amd64 system (at which time it is
    assumed to belong to the host architecture), as opposed to when it
    is found in the Packages file for an i386 apt repository.
  * d/scripts/steam: Quote variables defensively
  * Demote nvidia-driver-libs-i386 from Recommends to Suggests.
    These drivers are only required on systems where the NVIDIA proprietary
    driver is in use, but the amd64 proprietary driver in nvidia-driver-libs
    already Recommends nvidia-driver-libs-i386, and the kernel driver
    nvidia-kernel-dkms Recommends nvidia-driver, which Depends on
    nvidia-driver-libs; so the only way a user of the proprietary NVIDIA
    driver could fail to have nvidia-driver-libs:i386 installed is if
    they are already disregarding Recommends.
    Keeping this driver in our Suggests means its presence or absence will
    normally be mentioned in bug reports for this package.

      suites are no longer interesting.
