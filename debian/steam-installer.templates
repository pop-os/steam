_Description: 32-bit Nvidia driver (nvidia-driver-libs-i386) required
 This computer appears to be using the Nvidia binary graphics driver
 (the nvidia-driver package).
 .
 Steam is a 32-bit program, so running it on this computer requires the
 32-bit versions of the Nvidia libraries, even if all the games you will
 run via Steam are 64-bit. Please install the nvidia-driver-libs-i386
 package.
 .
 For full functionality (including Vulkan), also install the libraries
 listed as Recommends in the nvidia-driver-libs-i386 package.
 .
 If you are using a legacy version of the Nvidia driver such as
 nvidia-legacy-340xx-driver, please install the corresponding 32-bit legacy
 package, for example nvidia-legacy-340xx-driver-libs-i386.
