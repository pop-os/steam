   <summary>Launcher for the Steam software distribution service</summary>
   <description>
     <p>Steam is a software distribution service with an online store, automated
       installation, automatic updates, achievements, SteamCloud synchronized
       savegame and screenshot functionality, and many social features.</p>
+    <p>This unofficial package provides a script that downloads and installs
+      the Steam client, and depends on 32-bit and 64-bit libraries and
+      other components that are required by the Steam client. The actual
+      Steam installation and all Steam games will be installed into the
+      home directory of each user who runs the installer script.</p>
+    <p>Because Steam requires 32-bit libraries, before installing this package
+      it will be necessary to run, as root:
+      <code>dpkg --add-architecture i386; apt update</code></p>
